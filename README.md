# Dodge Master Game

### Backstory:

The initial idea was to make a minimalist version of the Jetpack Joyride game. But, because the game takes place on a 8x8 LED matrix, simulating smooth jet pack propulsion and gravity on a Y axis with just 8 points doesn't give a nice feeling. So, the new idea was to make something similar to the Temple Run game which doesn't focus so much on gravity.

### Game description:

Dodge Master is an endless runner type of game. You are fast runner and you want to see how much can you resist continuously running on a dangerous path. During your endless run, you will encounter different walls and projectiles coming at you from the front. Also, during the first part of the run, you will increase in speed. The higher the distance traveled, the more the points obtained.

### Instructions:

Use the joystick to move left and right on the matrix width to dodge incoming obstacles. Try to dodge obstacles as much time as you can.

### Components:
  * Arduino Uno microcontroller board
  * Breadboard (x2)
  * LCD
  * MAX7219 Driver
  * 8x8 LED Matrix 
  * Joystick
  * Buzzer
  * Resistors and wires
  
### Additional Notes:
  * The app can be compiled with C++17 (or newer) version of the standard.
